Typescript dependency injection

This is a _test_ repository illustrating typescript dependency injection for a presentation at [Sfeir](https://www.sfeir.com/fr/).  

Please, DO NOT use this in production ; this is for test purpose only. There are plenty of great dependency injection libraries on github, please use them instead of this.
